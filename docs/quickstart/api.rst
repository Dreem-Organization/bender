API
######

The easiest way to use and test our API is with the following **Postman** collection where you should find everything you need.

**Just a friendly warning to tell you that postman currently doesn't handle automatic cookies clearing and that if you were in any way having some troubles with our collection, just try to wipe cookies manually with postman's UI.**

How to use it
-------------

Install postman `by clicking here. <https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/>`_ 

Import our collection following `these steps. <https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/collections/data_formats/#exporting-and-importing-postman-data>`_

Get the postman json file you need to import `over here. <>`_
