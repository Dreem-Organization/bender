It's the only client that you can use to compare all your **Trials** and all your **Algos** by visualizing them on graphs and ranking boards.

Let's make a tour of the web client :

Here you can perform some basic actions like looking at your profile informations and update them, loging out, reporting some bug or contact us.

The Bender logo at the top indicates the activity of the page. When the antena of bender is broadcasting it means that the page is loading some elements : be patient. ;)

You can hide or show this menu by clicking on the little arrow on the side.

Here you can see all your different **Algos** ranked by a selected performance metric.

By clicking a column title you can rearange the ranking depending on this new metric.

By clicking a cell you can display the specific set of hyperparameters used to get this result.

To create a new **Algo** just click the green plus sign at the bottom.

On **Algo** cell hover, two buttons appears : edit and delete.

And still within the **Algo** cell you have 2 buttons to enter the **Trials Board** and explore all your **Trials** either with a line chart or a scatter chart.
